# The FateX game system for FoundryVTT
FateX is the **extended Fate game system** for FoundryVTT. This system allows you to play **any Fate game you want**.
It provides default options for playing **Fate Core, Fate Accelerated, and Fate Condensed**, but can be used in **all its derivative systems too**.

You're able to define your own aspects, skill lists, stress tracks, consequences, conditions, stunts, extras, and more.

Using the **"Actor template system"**, you're able to create and manage multiple templates which new actors may be based on.
This allows you to have different base-sheets for PCs, NPCs, monsters, and any other type of character you can imagine.

It's possible to use different mechanics for different character types. While PCs may have core-style stress tracks (1,2,3,4), NPCs could have condensed style stress tracks (1,1,1,1). You're fully flexible to play the Fate game **you** want.
